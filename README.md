## Introduction
#### The main purpose of this project is to develop an API for sentiment analysis tasks using FastAPI, Docker, and Hugging Face Transformers. It passes input through the model to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Requirements
#### This project has the following dependencies.
* FastAPI: A framework for building APIs.
* Transformers: The Hugging Face library for (NLP) tasks.
* Pyngrok: A Python wrapper for ngrok, which exposes local servers over public URLs.
* Nest_asyncio: A library for running asyncio nested in other asyncio loops.
* Pydantic: A data validation library

## Code Overview
#### The main files of the code are:
* main.py: This file contains the FastAPI application, including the definition of endpoints, and model integration.
* test_.py: This file contains 3 tests for the API endpoints using FastAPI's TestClient.
* Dockerfile: The Dockerfile has all instructions for building the Docker image for the API.
* requirements.txt: This file has all the dependencies required by the project.
