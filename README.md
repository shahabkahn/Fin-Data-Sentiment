## Introduction
#### The main purpose of this project is to develop an API for sentiment analysis tasks using FastAPI, Docker, and Hugging Face Transformers. It passes input through the model to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Requirements
#### This project has the following dependencies.
* FastAPI: A framework for building APIs.
* Transformers: The Hugging Face library for (NLP) tasks.
* Pyngrok: A Python wrapper for ngrok, which exposes local servers over public URLs.
* Nest_asyncio: A library for running asyncio nested in other asyncio loops.
* Pydantic: A data validation library
